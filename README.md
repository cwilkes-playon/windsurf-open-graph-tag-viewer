# Graph Inspector

A modern, stylish Nuxt.js application for analyzing and previewing Open Graph (OG) tags from any URL.

## Description

Graph Inspector provides a beautiful and intuitive interface to see how social media platforms and search engines will interpret your web pages. Simply enter a URL, and the application will fetch and display all associated Open Graph data, including:

-   **Titles and Descriptions:** See the exact text that will be displayed.
-   **Images:** Preview all `og:image` tags.
-   **Videos:** View embedded `og:video` content.
-   **All Tags:** A comprehensive table of every OG tag found on the page.

The application is built with Nuxt.js, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a dark-mode, "glassmorphism" design with smooth animations and a fully responsive layout.
